# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the Maxwell Software Solutions website.

## Security Headers

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
Add the HSTS header to ensure browsers always use secure HTTPS connections:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

**Implementation**: Configure this header in your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) or in `next.config.ts` using the `headers` configuration.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implement a Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:;
```

### Other Security Headers
Consider adding these headers:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevent clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevent MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Control referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()` - Control browser features

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enable MFA on all administrative accounts (GitHub, hosting provider, etc.)
- Use authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) or hardware keys (YubiKey)
- Enforce MFA for all team members with administrative access

### Password Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Consider using a password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Never commit credentials to version control

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Contact Forms and User Input
- Validate all user input on both client and server side
- Sanitize input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add CAPTCHA or honeypot fields to prevent spam

### API Security
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Use proper authentication tokens
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security events for monitoring

## Dependencies and Updates

### Regular Updates
- Keep Next.js, React, and all dependencies up to date
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit fix` to automatically fix known vulnerabilities
- Review security advisories for all dependencies

### Dependency Management
- Use exact versions in package.json for production
- Review new dependencies before adding them
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use tools like Dependabot for automated dependency updates

## Environment Variables and Secrets

### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use `.env.local` for local development (add to .gitignore)
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly
- Use separate credentials for different environments

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for failed login attempts
- Review server logs regularly
- Implement error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)

### Incident Response
- Have a documented incident response plan
- Know who to contact in case of a security incident
- Keep backups of all critical data
- Test backup restoration regularly

## SSL/TLS Configuration

### Certificate Management
- Use valid SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt, commercial CA)
- Enable automatic certificate renewal
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher
- Disable weak cipher suites
